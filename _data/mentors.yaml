  bio: I am currently a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. My background is in concurrency and parallel systems, and I know quite a bit about the C++ memory model and programming concurrent applications in C++, as well as a good knowledge of various parallel approaches (e.g. OpenMP, CUDA, MPI, etc.). As a lecturer, I have developed our Games Development programme at Edinburgh Napier, and have developed a framework for computer graphics in OpenGL and a C++ game engine. As a software engineer, I have good knowledge and understanding of engineering approaches and have a good working knowledge of OO principles, etc. in C++. I also currently teach C and C++ to our first-year students and therefore have knowledge and material for teaching beginners as well as more experienced programmers.
